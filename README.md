# Sore_Soccer
Sore_Soccer Program for tryout and practice team selection. 

This code takes lists of experienced and inexperienced players and evenly distributes the lists into a series of open variable team lists. t prints and writes these teams to files. This code can be manipulated to incorporate more teams. It also has the potential to take player data and filter physical characteristics and position into the team generator. Altogether, this program, with modifications and additions, can take raw player provided data and generate balanced teams with equal numbers of positions and player levels. Saving these teams to files will allow us to modify these teams as tryouts progress over the three day period. These additions are well within what I have learned throughout the semester and would be a true test of list management, file management, function definitions, sorting, and other python fundamentals. This applied learning would help demonstrate to the professor that the EDX modules have been retained and that the code we have learned can also be applied correctly.
